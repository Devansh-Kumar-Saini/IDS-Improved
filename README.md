## What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security technology that monitors network or host activity to detect suspicious behavior that may indicate a security policy violation, attack, or compromise. IDSs can be used to alert administrators, log events for later analysis, or trigger automated defenses.

### Primary types of IDS
- Network-based IDS (NIDS): Monitors traffic on a network segment and inspects packets/flows (e.g., Snort, Suricata).
- Host-based IDS (HIDS): Monitors activity on a single host (processes, file changes, system calls, logs).
- Hybrid IDS: Combines both network and host signals for richer detection.

### Common detection approaches
- Signature-based (misuse detection): Matches traffic patterns to known attack signatures. Low false positives for known attacks but cannot detect novel attacks.
- Anomaly-based: Learns a model of normal behavior and flags deviations as potential intrusions. Better for unknown attacks but often has higher false positives.
- Stateful / protocol-aware: Inspects protocol semantics and long-lived sessions for subtle misuse.
- Hybrid / ensemble approaches: Combine both signature and anomaly techniques to reduce weaknesses of each.

### Deployment points and tradeoffs
- Inline vs passive: Inline allows blocking but adds latency; passive is safer for monitoring.
- Centralized vs distributed analysis: Centralized simplifies correlation; distributed reduces single points of failure.
- Real-time vs batch analysis: Real-time is needed for active defence; batch is often used for model development and periodic audits.

## About this project (IDS-Improved)

This repository provides an IDS prototype and research tooling implemented in Python with an emphasis on "improved" detection through careful data preprocessing, robust modeling, and post-hoc explanation. The project is designed to be a starting point for experimentation and research; it focuses on modular pipelines so you can swap datasets, features, and models easily.

### Goals
- Provide a reproducible pipeline for training and evaluating IDS models.
- Demonstrate modern best practices: feature engineering, class-imbalance handling, hyperparameter search, and model explainability.
- Make it easy to test multiple ML/DL models and compare their performance.
- Offer utility scripts/notebooks for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.

### Key ideas and improvements
- Balanced modelling: address class imbalance using resampling (SMOTE, ADASYN), class weights, or threshold tuning.
- Strong feature engineering: flow aggregation, time-windowed features, one-hot encoding for categorical fields, normalization.
- Ensemble & hybrid detectors: combine anomaly scorers (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forest) with discriminative classifiers (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost).
- Explainability: integrate SHAP/feature-importance outputs so alerts are more actionable.
- Evaluation beyond accuracy: use detection rate, false positive rate, precision/recall/F1, AUC, and confusion matrices.

### High-level architecture
- data/: dataset ingestion and preprocessing utilities
- features/: feature engineering and transformation steps
- models/: training routines, saved model artifacts, and utilities
- notebooks/: exploratory analyses and reproducible experiments
- scripts/: CLI entrypoints (train, evaluate, infer)
- api/: optional lightweight REST API (Flask/FastAPI) for real-time inference

(Repository layout is a recommendation — adjust paths to actual code structure in this repo.)

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (3.9/3.10 recommended)
- CPU or GPU (optional; GPU recommended for deep models)
- Typical Python dependencies (example):
  - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, xgboost, joblib
  - shap, matplotlib, seaborn
  - jupyterlab (for notebooks)
  - fastapi / uvicorn or flask (optional for API)

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
- python -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate  (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
- pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't yet have a requirements.txt, a minimal starter list:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- xgboost
- joblib
- shap
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Devansh-Kumar-Saini/IDS-Improved.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (see above)
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Typical workflow
1. Put raw dataset files in data/raw/
2. Run preprocessing:
   python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/raw/yourfile.csv --output data/processed/train.csv
3. Train a model:
   python scripts/train.py --config configs/train.yaml
4. Evaluate:
   python scripts/evaluate.py --model models/latest.pkl --test data/processed/test.csv
5. Inspect explanations:
   python notebooks/interpretability.ipynb

If scripts are not present in this repo, use the notebooks to run the pipeline step-by-step.

## Datasets and preprocessing

Recommended public datasets for IDS experiments:
- NSL-KDD (improved KDD'99)
- CICIDS2017 (modern network flows with labeled attacks)
- UNSW-NB15
- CSE-CIC-IDS2018

Preprocessing tips:
- Convert pcap / flows to structured CSV with semantic fields (src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, dst_port, protocol, duration, bytes, packets, flags, etc.).
- Aggregate flows into time windows (e.g., per second/minute) for context-aware features.
- Handle categorical fields with one-hot or target encoding.
- Normalize or scale numeric features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).
- Remove or impute missing values sensibly; avoid leaking labels into preprocessing steps.
- Split by time (train on older data, test on newer) to reflect realistic deployment.

---

## Models and training

This repository encourages experimenting with a variety of approaches:

Classical ML
- RandomForest, GradientBoosting / XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression
Anomaly detection
- Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoder reconstruction error
Deep learning (for sequence/flow data)
- LSTM / GRU for sequential flows
- Autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly scoring

Practical suggestions
- Use stratified splits for balanced evaluation when applicable.
- For severe imbalance, try class weights, focal loss, or resampling (SMOTE).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation and grid / randomized search.
- Save model artifacts and preprocessing pipelines (use joblib or pickle) for consistent inference.

---

## Evaluation and metrics

Use a mix of metrics to get a full picture:
- Confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)
- Precision, Recall, F1-score (macro/micro/weighted)
- Detection Rate (True Positive Rate) and False Positive Rate
- ROC AUC and PR AUC (precision-recall area under curve)
- Per-class breakdown (some attack classes are harder to detect)

Report both aggregate metrics and class-level behaviors. In production, false positives are costly — tune thresholds and incorporate human review or tiered alerting.

---

## Inference / deployment suggestions

- Export a model and preprocessing pipeline together (e.g., a pipeline object containing scalers and encoder).
- Provide a lightweight infer API (FastAPI or Flask) that:
  - Accepts a flow/feature JSON
  - Applies preprocessing pipeline
  - Runs model.predict or model.decision_function
  - Returns score, label, and important features / explanations
- If deploying inline, consider latency constraints and model size; use simpler models or quantized models.
- Log model decisions for audit and to enable continual retraining.

---

## Explainability & interpretability

Explainable outputs make IDS alerts actionable:
- Use SHAP or feature importance to explain why a flow was flagged.
- Provide top-k contributing features with each alarm.
- Maintain a human-readable alert message that includes context (time, endpoints, score, rationale).
- Save explanation metadata with alerts for later forensics.

---

## Tips, troubleshooting, and best practices

- Always keep train/test separation strict — avoid leaking temporal context.
- When evaluating anomaly detection, calibrate thresholds on a validation set and monitor drift over time.
- Track experiments (weights, hyperparameters, dataset version) with a simple experiment log or a tool like MLflow.
- When results are unexpectedly poor:
  - Check data leakage
  - Re-evaluate feature distributions
  - Inspect for mislabeled ground truth
  - Validate pipeline steps numerically (sample transformations)
